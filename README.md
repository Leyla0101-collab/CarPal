# CarPal
Parking shortages at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Shah Alam cause congestion and wasted time due to the lack of a real-time parking system. CarPal – Smart Parking Finder, developed in July 2025, is a mobile application that uses GPS and real-time data to help users locate available parking spaces efficiently.
